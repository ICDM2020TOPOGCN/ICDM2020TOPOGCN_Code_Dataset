# Extract persistence images and persistence diagrams from images

- Extract wheel images and labels from HDF5file
- Apply lower-star filtration (by using Dionysus 2) to extract corresponding persistence diagrams from each image
- Convert persistence diagrams to persistence images with PersIm
- For persistence diagrams, we consider (i) original persistence diagrams (ii) persistence diagrams with rotation (iii) persistence diagrams with rotation and with five persistent points which have the longest lifespan.
